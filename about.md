Light Forest is our space to work with our favorite people, demystify crypto for 
some of the world’s oldest multigenerational family offices, and generate stellar 
investment returns through hands-on participation in the development of new technology. 

We invest in companies focused on Crypto or Machine Learning, and preferably both. 
We see synergies between these and are excited for the future where ML agents can 
freely participate in market economies with their blockchain wallets. There is 
plenty of Crypto infrastructure to build on the way to that dream, and we are 
honored to partner with the best companies in the space building that scaffolding, 
in addition to building solutions from our own lab.

If you think we're a good match as investors or would like someone to build with you, 
feel free to reach out to <a href="{{site["cinjon"].web}}">Cinjon</a>.

        <b>Dino</b> started his career as an analyst doing value investing in global equities in 2011. Noticing that certain internet and tech business models were persistently undervalued, he focused his attention on them until taking an interest in crypto during the 2016 bear market. He made angel investments in projects such as Decentraland, Terra, Connext, Zenledger and helped manage a collective pool of capital from 2017-2018. He also made a couple of rare pepes. He helped launch Light Forest with Cinjon after working on Blueprint Forest’s long-only public equities launch from 2020-2022.
